## What is this? ##
This is a monthly log that I will use to capture my progress as I learn to code, in the spirit of Learning in Public. (Even though I'm learning in public, some of these notes may only make sense to me.)    

My goals with the logs:
1. All Non-Zero days - update the log daily with the stuff I worked on.
2. Use the logs from the previous week as kindling, my goals for the following week as tinder, and my feelings in the moment as the spark to write fire weekly blog posts (and you'd better believe that if we're using logs as kindling, we're gonna light some big ol' fires). Then, tweet the summary and a link to the post.
3. Each month, create new monthly goals that can be broken down into weekly goals.

### March 2020 Goals
1. Ship thankyounot.es as full blown webpage (as described in [MVP spec](https://jacob-berkelhamer.github.io/thankyounot.es-MVP-Spec/){:target="\_blank").
2. Reach out to 1 more finance/accounting --> SWE pro
3. Organize blog (i.e. create sections for blog posts, logs, projects, etc).

### March 2020 Log
**2020/03/01**: continued working on FCC intermediate algo problems    
**2020/03/02**: continued working on FCC intermediate algo problems    
**2020/03/03**: read YDKJSY    
**2020/03/04**: read YDKJSY    
**2020/03/05**: finished YDKJSY Book 2, CH 3 - on to Chapter 4: Around the Global Scope!   
**2020/03/06**: continued reading YDKJSY Book 2 Ch 4; continued FCC intermediate algo problem.    
**2020/03/07**: continued working on FCC intermediate algo problem.    
**2020/03/08**: continued working on FCC intermediate algo problem - I'm stuck on finding the smallest common multiple, but am going to go with a pretty naive solution because I want to keep the momentum going! I've been feeling kind of bad about my limited updates to this blog and about the few posts I've made over the last two months. It's been tough for me to continue to add stuff for personal reasons, but I have had all non-zero days still and continue to want to make progress. part of what's tough is I haven't been spending as much time total on programming, and I don't want to take away from that time to do more ancillary activities like reaching out to people or figureing out how to reconfigure the blog in jekyll, which is all in ruby and therefore pretty foreign to me. I think the best use of my time is to write, write, write as much code as possible. This is not to say that adding to the blog or reaching out to people is un-useful, but that I should prioritize them lower. Writing code is foundational and if I don't get skilled at that, there is no point to reaching out to people or writing long posts. I still value learning in public, hence I am at least updating these logs. Maybe I can start prioritizing my time better in general and keep my "ancillary" programming learning activities to a set portion of the total time I spend doing all activities related to learning to code. I don't know the best answer here but I just need something that works. Either way, writing this all out is a bit of a weight off my shoulders because, as mentioned above, I have been feeling pretty bad about my lack of progress on my "monthly goals" and total lack of progress on the thankyounot.es project. All that being said, I'm glad I've continued to chip away at the progress and plan to keep going!    
**2020/03/09**: continued reading about the global scope in YDKJSY. continued fcc intermediate algo problems and finally, finally, FINALLY got through the smallest common multiple problem.....woooooooooo-EEEEE. Need to read about the various alternative solutions I could have attempted, including Euclid's algorithm...I have a sense that this problem will come up again.   
**2020/03/10**: finished YDKJSY b2c4 Around the Global Scope - biggest applicable takeaway for now is to use var to initialize variables in the global scope. Continued working on fCC steamroller problem and it's pretty tough!    
**2020/03/11**: continued working on fCC steamroller problem.    
**2020/03/12**: knocked out the fcc steamroller problem (by the grace of our Lord) and moved through a few other problems, including converting a sequence of binary numbers to sentences via their converted decimal ASCII codes - the FCC hints had a super cool advanced solution that involved using Array.prototype.match with a regexp and \`0b....\` notation to show that we were converting from binary! Super super cool stuff; blaze on!    
**2020/03/13**: working on "arguments optional" fcc intermediate algo problem and _not lovin' it_. I remember coming across a practice problem like this and it making sense then...but not sure where I came across the problem. Need to look through fcc curriculum and maybe the forum. There's no shame in needing help, but there is shame in giving up. I feel a little stuck in the algorithm problems, which is tough because I felt like the algorithms were kind of my strong suit, and I feel like I'm spinning my wheels a bit. Maybe need to start on Udemy course? Idk.    
**2020/03/14**: continued working on fcc.    
**2020/03/15**: read more about currying - time to apply the learning to the fcc problem I've been stuck on.    
**2020/03/16**: finished fCC intermediate algorithm scripting section!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! on to the FINAL CHALLENGES.    
**2020/03/17**: completed fCC JS palindrome problem with a decent solution. I want to try the advanced solution which has much better performance but need a bit of time to forget about it first.    
**2020/03/18**: finished fcc Roman Numerals problem with about the most naive possible solution - want to see if I can enhance it via thinking of roman numerals as series of 1s and 5s.
