## What is this? ##
This is a monthly log that I will use to capture my progress as I learn to code, in the spirit of Learning in Public. (Even though I'm learning in public, some of these notes may only make sense to me.)    

My goals with the logs:
1. All Non-Zero days - update the log daily with the stuff I worked on.
2. Use the logs from the previous week as kindling, my goals for the following week as tinder, and my feelings in the moment as the spark to write fire weekly blog posts (and you'd better believe that if we're using logs as kindling, we're gonna light some big ol' fires). Then, tweet the summary and a link to the post.
3. Each month, create new monthly goals that can be broken down into weekly goals.

### March 2020 Goals
1. Ship thankyounot.es as full blown webpage (as described in [MVP spec](https://jacob-berkelhamer.github.io/thankyounot.es-MVP-Spec/){:target="\_blank").
2. Reach out to 1 more finance/accounting --> SWE pro
3. Organize blog (i.e. create sections for blog posts, logs, projects, etc).

### March 2020 Log
**2020/03/01**: continued working on FCC intermediate algo problems    
**2020/03/02**: continued working on FCC intermediate algo problems    
**2020/03/03**: read YDKJSY    
**2020/03/04**: read YDKJSY    
**2020/03/05**: finished YDKJSY Book 2, CH 3 - on to Chapter 4: Around the Global Scope!   
**2020/03/06**: continued reading YDKJSY Book 2 Ch 4; continued FCC intermediate algo problem.    
**2020/03/07**: continued working on FCC intermediate algo problem.    
**2020/03/08**: continued working on FCC intermediate algo problem - I'm stuck on finding the smallest common multiple, but am going to go with a pretty naive solution because I want to keep the momentum going! I've been feeling kind of bad about my limited updates to this blog and about the few posts I've made over the last two months. It's been tough for me to continue to add stuff for personal reasons, but I have had all non-zero days still and continue to want to make progress. part of what's tough is I haven't been spending as much time total on programming, and I don't want to take away from that time to do more ancillary activities like reaching out to people or figureing out how to reconfigure the blog in jekyll, which is all in ruby and therefore pretty foreign to me. I think the best use of my time is to write, write, write as much code as possible. This is not to say that adding to the blog or reaching out to people is un-useful, but that I should prioritize them lower. Writing code is foundational and if I don't get skilled at that, there is no point to reaching out to people or writing long posts. I still value learning in public, hence I am at least updating these logs. Maybe I can start prioritizing my time better in general and keep my "ancillary" programming learning activities to a set portion of the total time I spend doing all activities related to learning to code. I don't know the best answer here but I just need something that works. Either way, writing this all out is a bit of a weight off my shoulders because, as mentioned above, I have been feeling pretty bad about my lack of progress on my "monthly goals" and total lack of progress on the thankyounot.es project. All that being said, I'm glad I've continued to chip away at the progress and plan to keep going!    
**2020/03/09**: continued reading about the global scope in YDKJSY. continued fcc intermediate algo problems and finally, finally, FINALLY got through the smallest common multiple problem.....woooooooooo-EEEEE. Need to read about the various alternative solutions I could have attempted, including Euclid's algorithm...I have a sense that this problem will come up again.   
**2020/03/10**: finished YDKJSY b2c4 Around the Global Scope - biggest applicable takeaway for now is to use var to initialize variables in the global scope. Continued working on fCC steamroller problem and it's pretty tough!    
**2020/03/11**: continued working on fCC steamroller problem.    
**2020/03/12**: knocked out the fcc steamroller problem (by the grace of our Lord) and moved through a few other problems, including converting a sequence of binary numbers to sentences via their converted decimal ASCII codes - the FCC hints had a super cool advanced solution that involved using Array.prototype.match with a regexp and \`0b....\` notation to show that we were converting from binary! Super super cool stuff; blaze on!    
**2020/03/13**: working on "arguments optional" fcc intermediate algo problem and _not lovin' it_. I remember coming across a practice problem like this and it making sense then...but not sure where I came across the problem. Need to look through fcc curriculum and maybe the forum. There's no shame in needing help, but there is shame in giving up. I feel a little stuck in the algorithm problems, which is tough because I felt like the algorithms were kind of my strong suit, and I feel like I'm spinning my wheels a bit. Maybe need to start on Udemy course? Idk.    
**2020/03/14**: continued working on fcc.    
**2020/03/15**: read more about currying - time to apply the learning to the fcc problem I've been stuck on.    
**2020/03/16**: finished fCC intermediate algorithm scripting section!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! on to the FINAL CHALLENGES.    
**2020/03/17**: completed fCC JS palindrome problem with a decent solution. I want to try the advanced solution which has much better performance but need a bit of time to forget about it first.    
**2020/03/18**: finished fcc Roman Numerals problem with about the most naive possible solution - want to see if I can enhance it via thinking of roman numerals as series of 1s and 5s.    
**2020/03/19**: finished fcc Caesars Cipher problem - could have improved it by thinking of using ASCII characters. Also had to look up wrapping around an array using the modulo because I couldn't remember exactly how to do it. The third Get Help solution [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/forum/t/freecodecamp-challenge-guide-caesars-cipher/16003){:target="\_blank") does a fantastic job of explaining it. I may have another link somewhere in these logs......I should look. Anyway, only 2 more problems to solve before I get my JS Algos and Data Structures Cert! This is craziness - it would be incredible to knock it out over the weekend here.     
**2020/03/20**: finished fcc Telephone Number Validator problem.    
**2020/03/21**: finished fcc Cash Register problem......and earned the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification!!!ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ - I'm pretty happy that I was able to get through that part of the curriculum, and while I likely need to go back through and repeat a few individual lessons that I've forgotten, it feels good to have earned the Cert. Very excited to see what's next - maybe jump over to the Colt Steele Udemy course? maybe finish thankyounot.es???! hahahaha    
**2020/03/22**: began to add JS logic to thankyounot.es. finished fCC basic html section.    
**2020/03/23**: began looking into fcc API lessons. did some basic css lessons.    
**2020/03/24**: continued with fCC's css lessons! thinking it might be nice to get back into some YDKJSY reading.   
**2020/03/25**: continued w fCC's css lessons - learned about css variables for the first time which are cool     
**2020/03/26**: finished fcc css basic lessons and moved on to basic applied visual design which is interesting    
**2020/03/27**: continued working on fcc basic applied visual design challenges.    
**2020/03/28**: finished fcc basic applied visual design section. started Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp Udemy course! got through first few intro sections and will pick up with basic html next. I think my "structured learning" will come from this Udemy course for the next few months, and I can continue working through fcc challenges on the side, or do codewars to keep practicing js as the Udemy course does not get to js lessons for a while. very excited to get into some backend dev stuff (eventually - though I guess I could jump into doing it whenever I wanted outside of Udemy) and to do a bunch of projects along the way.    
**2020/03/29**: began Colt Steele Udemy Web Dev Bootcamp course and got through opening material - should be interesting!    
**2020/03/30**: continued Udemy course and am halfway through beginner html lessons. Did a kata in codewars and am liking it. I want to keep practicing JS so my skills don't get too rusty before I'm deeper into the Udemy course.    
**2020/03/31**: continued Udemy course html section - learned a bit about the difference between divs (block level) and spans (in-line). this month has both flown by and dragged on like no other-pretty crazy month, but I'm glad I've made so much progress! Especially earning the JS cert from freecodecamp. No ragrets baby!
