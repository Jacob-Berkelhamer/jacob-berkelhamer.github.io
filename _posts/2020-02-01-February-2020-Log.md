## What is this? ##
This is a monthly log that I will use to capture my progress as I learn to code, in the spirit of Learning in Public. (Even though I'm learning in public, some of these notes may only make sense to me.)

My goals with the logs:
1. All Non-Zero days - update the log daily with the stuff I worked on.
2. Use the logs from the previous week as kindling, my goals for the following week as tinder, and my feelings in the moment as the spark to write fire ~weekly blog posts (and you'd better believe that if we're using logs as kindling, we're gonna light some big ol' fires). Then, tweet the summary and a link to the post.
3. Each month, create new monthly goals that can be broken down into weekly goals.

### February 2020 Goals
1. Ship thankyounot.es as full blown webpage (as described in [MVP spec](https://jacob-berkelhamer.github.io/thankyounot.es-MVP-Spec/){:target="\_blank").
2. ~~Download and work within an IDE.~~
3. Reach out to 3 more finance/accounting --> SWE pros. ( 1  2  3 )
4. Organize blog (i.e. create sections for blog posts, logs, projects, etc).

### February 2020 Log
**2020/02/01**: downloaded mobile ide and continued working on Albert A's week three hw problem (which led to learning about Set object), read about the difference between an IDE and text editor, read [this](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-you-start-a-career-in-a-different-field-without-experience-tips-that-got-me-job-offers-from-7425f590f3eb/){:target="\_blank"} AWESOME article about starting a career in a different field without the traditional experience, continued FCC OOP lessons which are super interesting! Made some nice target="\_blank" updates to Jan logs and added this new page! LET'S KEEP THIS TRAIN ROLLING BABY CHOO CHOOOOOOOOOOOO    
**2020/02/02**: created thank you note content arrays and started on randomizer functions for thankyounot.es, continued FCC OOP lessons, continued listening to interview of Quincy Larson, congratulated KC Chiefs on SB LIV win!    
**2020/02/03**: read through some good posts on r/cscareerquestions, continued working on Albert A's week 3 hw problem (gave up Set object for if statement nested in for loop - may need to wrap for loop in function), continued listening to podcast interview of Q-Lars, finished FCC OOP lessons and started JS Functional Programming lessons!    
**2020/02/04**: finished Albert A AMA week 3 hw question ([here](https://www.playcode.io/494350){:target="\_blank"}) and posted to Slack, continued reading YDKJS, continued FCC functional programming lessons, continued listening to Quincy Larson interview (BIG takeaway: by keeping fCC free with high quality content, forcing everyone else to raise the bar on their content - like my McDonald's vs local restaurant theory), wrote January post-mortem and posted to Twitter. Took a deep breath and appreciated that LIFE IS GOOD!    
**2020/02/05**: finished YDKJS Getting Started appendix A - onto the practice problems in Appendix B! The first one is already challenging, so I am excited to learn from this appendix. Began watching recording of Albert A's AMA week 1, as I was unable to attend in person, and am taking notes in Slack. Completed [fizzbuzz](https://www.playcode.io/495032){:target="\_blank"} for the first time and explained lines 4 and 5 in detail to a JS beginner, which was unexpectedly enjoyable. I think I like teaching!    
**2020/02/06** attended Albert A's Week 4 AMA which involved looking over other attendees' week 3 hw attempts and learning about their coding process in detail (saw some python and java code), and connected with another guy who is going from finance --> swe. I think we will be working on some projects together, which should be exciting! Will have a brainstorming session with him this weekend. After a few days off, I want to get back into FCC's lessons so I can keep learning more JS!    
**2020/02/07**: completed practice problem #1 (coercion) from YDKJS Getting Started    
**2020/02/08**: continued FCC functional programming JS lessons, continued listening to podcast interview of Quincy Larson    
**2020/02/09**: spoke with fellow student from Albert A's group and will be starting a project with him! Also learned about Apple Shortcuts app thanks to him and will be setting up at least one shortcut to make life easier. finished podcast interview of Quincy Larson and even more impressed by freeCodeCamp now (definitely need to #PayItBackwards at some point). continued FCC functional programming lessons.    
**2020/02/10**: mocked up train data project skeleton in codepen and obtained relevant API key. read through some interesting r/cscareerquestions and r/webdev posts. found r/sideprojects as well! Did YDKJS Getting Started Appendix B Closure practice problem - did not get it exactly right but learned that when waiting on second function call if only one argument supplied (with option to have two arguments supplied), good to have multiple internal functions ("child functions"?) that point towards the ultimate, correct set of steps - ie what you want function to ideally do when all arguments are supplied.    
**2020/02/11**: downloaded VS Code, Git, and node.js + npm + express and had a fun ole time trying to figure out what the heck I'm supposed to do with these. As mentioned to coding buddy, "it's hard work moving from the sandbox to the playground" -- found a good resource on (of course) MDN on [setting up a Node dev environment](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/development_environment){:target="\_blank"} and will rely on this heavily to continue working on train data project (the genesis of the IDE download was to be able to hide my super secret API key on my computer but upload the rest of the train data project code to github so that I can add it to my portfolio). Continued FCC functional programming lessons.     
**2020/02/12**: began working on YDKJS Getting Started Appendix B Prototype practice problem (difficult!), went through FCC basic HTML lessons, edited styling in thankyounot.es mockup.    
**2020/02/13**: got to good point in YDKJS GS ApB Prototype pp and will likely be able to finish it soon! continued reading about api for train data project and learned about Google's GTFS format for real time transit data. continued working on fcc functional programming problems.    
**2020/02/14**: finished YDKJS GS ApB Prototype pp and therefore YDKJS Book 1!!!!!!! I still want to do a deeper comparison of my solution to the YDKJS suggested solution to learn exactly what's going on, but this feels good! Finished FCC functional programming section and began the intermediate algo section. Did a few intro lessons in Git in this cool website [learn git branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/){:target="\_blank"} that teaches you Git visually. Found out about Google Firebase which looks cool.
