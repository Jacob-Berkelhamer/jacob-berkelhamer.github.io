## What is this? ##
This is a monthly log that I will use to capture my progress as I learn to code, in the spirit of Learning in Public. (Even though I'm learning in public, some of these notes may only make sense to me.)

My goals with the logs:
1. All Non-Zero days - update the log daily with the stuff I worked on.
2. Use the logs from the previous week as kindling, my goals for the following week as tinder, and my feelings in the moment as the spark to write  fire weekly blog posts (and you'd better believe that if we're using logs as kindling, we're gonna light some big ol' fires). Then, tweet the summary and a link to the post.
3. Each month, create new monthly goals that can be broken down into weekly goals.

### February 2020 Goals
1. Ship thankyounot.es as full blown webpage (as described in [MVP spec](https://jacob-berkelhamer.github.io/thankyounot.es-MVP-Spec/){:target="\_blank").
2. _Download and work within an IDE._ (Currently determining whether this is worthwhile goal)
3. Reach out to 3 more finance/accounting --> SWE pros.
4. Organize blog (i.e. create sections for blog posts, logs, projects, etc).

### February 2020 Log
**2020/02/01**: downloaded mobile ide and continued working on Albert A's week three hw problem (which led to learning about Set object), read about the difference between an IDE and text editor, read [this](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-you-start-a-career-in-a-different-field-without-experience-tips-that-got-me-job-offers-from-7425f590f3eb/){:target="\_blank"} AWESOME article about starting a career in a different field without the traditional experience, continued FCC OOP lessons which are super interesting! Made some nice target="\_blank" updates to Jan logs and added this new page! LET'S KEEP THIS TRAIN ROLLING BABY CHOO CHOOOOOOOOOOOO    
**2020/02/02**: created thank you note content arrays and started on randomizer functions for thankyounot.es, continued FCC OOP lessons, continued listening to interview of Quincy Larson, congratulated KC Chiefs on SB LIV win!    
**2020/02/03**: read through some good posts on r/cscareerquestions, continued working on Albert A's week 3 hw problem (gave up Set object for if statement nested in for loop - may need to wrap for loop in function), continued listening to podcast interview of Q-Lars, finished FCC OOP lessons and started JS Functional Programming lessons!    
**2020/02/04**: finished Albert A AMA week 3 hw question ([here](https://www.playcode.io/494350){:target=\_blank"}) and posted to Slack, continued reading YDKJS, continued FCC functional programming lessons, continued listening to Quincy Larson interview (BIG takeaway: by keeping fCC free with high quality content, forcing everyone else to raise the bar on their content - like my McDonald's vs local restaurant theory), wrote January post-mortem and posted to Twitter. Took a deep breath and appreciated that LIFE IS GOOD!    
**2020/02/05**: finished YDKJS Getting Started appendix A - onto the practice problems in Appendix B! The first one is already challenging, so I am excited to learn from this appendix. Began watching recording of Albert A's AMA week 1, as I was unable to attend in person, and am taking notes in Slack. Completed [fizzbuzz](https://www.playcode.io/495032){:target=\_blank"} for the first time and explained lines 4 and 5 in detail to a JS beginner, which was unexpectedly enjoyable. I think I like teaching!
