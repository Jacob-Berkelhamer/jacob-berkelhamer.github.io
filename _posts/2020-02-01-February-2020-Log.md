## What is this? ##
This is a monthly log that I will use to capture my progress as I learn to code, in the spirit of Learning in Public. (Even though I'm learning in public, some of these notes may only make sense to me.)

My goals with the logs:
1. All Non-Zero days - update the log daily with the stuff I worked on.
2. Use the logs from the previous week as kindling, my goals for the following week as tinder, and my feelings in the moment as the spark to write  fire weekly blog posts (and you'd better believe that if we're using logs as kindling, we're gonna light some big ol' fires). Then, tweet the summary and a link to the post.
3. Each month, create new monthly goals that can be broken down into weekly goals.

### February 2020 Goals
~~1. Create some goals for the rest of this month! (does this count?)~~
1. Complete thankyounot.es project using GitHub Pages (this is a stretch goal)
2. Reach out to at least one software dev who is self-taught and came from finance/accounting background.
