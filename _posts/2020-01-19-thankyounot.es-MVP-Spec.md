title: thankyounot.es MVP Spec
---

### Why this project?
To make it easier to write my wedding thank you notes.

### ELI5
Put basic information into the website, click a button, and _POOF_, a beautiful thank you note appears that you can copy onto paper.

### What does the MVP need (basic user stories)?
1. I can enter the names of the guests.
2. I can enter the gifts from those guests.
3. I can click a button that will create a (relatively) unique thank you note, that I can copy exactly onto paper.   

### What do I think I will neeed to do to create the MVP?
* Use HTML, CSS + Bootstrap to create 'survey' entry
* Use JS to capture responses and fill in skeleton of thank you note
* Randomly use slight variances in thank you note skeleton to generate different sounding thank you notes - I'll have to research best thank you notes on the web to get general skeletons.
* Add a 'new thank you note' button to return to survey page

###Post-Mortem - what did I actually do?
(details to come)


### Post-MVP Enhancements User Stories
1. I can use a scale of how close I am to the letter recipient that determines the tone of the letter.
2. After generating a thank you note, I can return to the entry page and change details without having to re-enter everything.
3. After generating a thank you note, I can click a button to regenerate the note with the same details, to see if I like the note better.
4. If I regenerate the note with the same details, if I like the first note better, I can return to the first note.
5. I can append a personalized message to the thank you note that gets spell checked, if I choose.
6. I find it easier to navigate the UI of the web page and I am impressed with the look and feel of the page.
