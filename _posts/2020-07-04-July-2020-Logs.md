## What is this? ##
This is a monthly log that I will use to capture my progress as I learn to code, in the spirit of Learning in Public. (Even though I'm learning in public, some of these notes may only make sense to me.)    

My goals with the logs:
1. All Non-Zero days - update the log daily with the stuff I worked on.
2. Use the logs from the previous week as kindling, my goals for the following week as tinder, and my feelings in the moment as the spark to write fire weekly blog posts (and you'd better believe that if we're using logs as kindling, we're gonna light some big ol' fires). Then, tweet the summary and a link to the post.
3. Each month, create new monthly goals that can be broken down into weekly goals.

### July 2020 Goals
**TBD**

### July 2020 Log
**2020-07-01**: continued learning.    
**2020-07-02**: continued learning.    
**2020-07-03**: added Show route to practice RESTful Aircraft blog app.    
**2020-07-04**: finished RESTful Aircraft blog app by adding Edit, Update, and Destroy routes. Began data associations section of the Udemy course. It's all downhill from here!         
**2020/07-05**: continued working on Data Associations section, learning about Embedding data vs Referencing data with "blog posts" as the example (one:many relationship because one user can have many blog posts, but each blog post only has one user). When embedding data, the blog post objects are embedded in an array in the user object (in the post property), whereas when refercing data, the post property's value is an array filled with object IDs, which _reference_ the various post objects.
