## What is this? ##
This is a monthly log that I will use to capture my progress as I learn to code, in the spirit of Learning in Public. (Even though I'm learning in public, some of these notes may only make sense to me.)    

My goals with the logs:
1. All Non-Zero days - update the log daily with the stuff I worked on.
2. Use the logs from the previous week as kindling, my goals for the following week as tinder, and my feelings in the moment as the spark to write fire weekly blog posts (and you'd better believe that if we're using logs as kindling, we're gonna light some big ol' fires). Then, tweet the summary and a link to the post.
3. Each month, create new monthly goals that can be broken down into weekly goals.

### April 2020 Goals
**TBD**

### April 2020 Log
**2020/04/01**: finished Udemy course basic HTML section and made it decently far into the Intermediate HTML section which is about forms. The form action and method attributes are interesting and are starting to get me excited about working with the frontend and backend together! Also, the validation that Chrome (and probably other browsers) innately do on input type="email" is super cool!    
**2020/04/02**: finished Udemy course intermediate HTML section - learned a lot about forms, when to use name attribute vs value attribute was pretty cool. Got started on the Basic CSS section. While the first few lessons have been super basic, the exciting part is working with various files that are connected!!! This is huge as this is how I can work with "real" projects in Github vs the built-in html/css/js connections in sandboxes like Codepen, which are, to be clear, super freaking awesome, but I am excited about working in a manner that is closer to how a real swe would; and I think this is how a real swe would do it for production code!    
**2020/04/03**: continued Udemy course CSS.    
**2020/04/04**: continued Udemy course CSS.  
**2020/04/05**: continued Udemy course CSS. Finished Intermediate CSS section and am going to move on to Bootstrap. A little nervous that jumping to Bootstrap means I'm going to be missing a lot of valuable practice, but I can always save my Bootstrap knowledge for later and dive a bit more into CSS with freecodecamp. Plus, freecodecamp has some fantastic projects to work on, and I'm feeling much less anxious about getting into them and more confident in my css knowledge. It's important not to get too bogged down in the details and just get sh!t done.....then I can make more projects and instead of putting in level 5 effort into 1 or 2 projects (5 x 2 = 10), I can put in level 3 effort into 5 projects, or more! and of course, 5 x 3 = 15. Is this an over-simplification? You'd better believe it, baby. But as Colt says in his course, as you keep going, you naturally learn the most-used css properties, and can dive in a bit more if you're interested or come across an interesting website that uses them. I think I need to move more towards this approach to help me move away from the analysis paralysis approach. I want to finish the race here and run in good form, I don't need to run perfect form and give up halfway through because I'm getting stressed out that my knees are bending a weird way or my feet aren't striking the ground perfectly; the point here is to balance learning and momentum in order to reach a better goal. Colt also recommended checking out [css zen garden](https://http://www.csszengarden.com/){:target="\_blank"} for a bit of inspiration as to how much css impacts a web page. dig it baby!
