## What is this? ##
This is a monthly log that I will use to capture my progress as I learn to code, in the spirit of Learning in Public. (Even though I'm learning in public, some of these notes may only make sense to me.)    

My goals with the logs:
1. All Non-Zero days - update the log daily with the stuff I worked on.
2. Use the logs from the previous week as kindling, my goals for the following week as tinder, and my feelings in the moment as the spark to write fire weekly blog posts (and you'd better believe that if we're using logs as kindling, we're gonna light some big ol' fires). Then, tweet the summary and a link to the post.
3. Each month, create new monthly goals that can be broken down into weekly goals.

### April 2020 Goals
**TBD**

### April 2020 Log
**2020/04/01**: finished Udemy course basic HTML section and made it decently far into the Intermediate HTML section which is about forms. The form action and method attributes are interesting and are starting to get me excited about working with the frontend and backend together! Also, the validation that Chrome (and probably other browsers) innately do on input type="email" is super cool!    
**2020/04/02**: finished Udemy course intermediate HTML section - learned a lot about forms, when to use name attribute vs value attribute was pretty cool. Got started on the Basic CSS section. While the first few lessons have been super basic, the exciting part is working with various files that are connected!!! This is huge as this is how I can work with "real" projects in Github vs the built-in html/css/js connections in sandboxes like Codepen, which are, to be clear, super freaking awesome, but I am excited about working in a manner that is closer to how a real swe would; and I think this is how a real swe would do it for production code!    
**2020/04/03**: continued Udemy course CSS.    
**2020/04/04**: continued Udemy course CSS.  
**2020/04/05**: continued Udemy course CSS. Finished Intermediate CSS section and am going to move on to Bootstrap. A little nervous that jumping to Bootstrap means I'm going to be missing a lot of valuable practice, but I can always save my Bootstrap knowledge for later and dive a bit more into CSS with freecodecamp. Plus, freecodecamp has some fantastic projects to work on, and I'm feeling much less anxious about getting into them and more confident in my css knowledge. It's important not to get too bogged down in the details and just get sh!t done.....then I can make more projects and instead of putting in level 5 effort into 1 or 2 projects (5 x 2 = 10), I can put in level 3 effort into 5 projects, or more! and of course, 5 x 3 = 15. Is this an over-simplification? You'd better believe it, baby. But as Colt says in his course, as you keep going, you naturally learn the most-used css properties, and can dive in a bit more if you're interested or come across an interesting website that uses them. I think I need to move more towards this approach to help me move away from the analysis paralysis approach. I want to finish the race here and run in good form, I don't need to run perfect form and give up halfway through because I'm getting stressed out that my knees are bending a weird way or my feet aren't striking the ground perfectly; the point here is to balance learning and momentum in order to reach a better goal. Colt also recommended checking out [css zen garden](https://http://www.csszengarden.com/){:target="\_blank"} for a bit of inspiration as to how much css impacts a web page. dig it baby!     
**2020/04/06**: started Udemy course's Bootstrap course and got halfway through - first half has been about basic elements of page like buttons, forms, jumbotron, and navbar and how we can fit them all into a container. I never realized bootstrap was just a giant css and js file that you could use and mess around with, and even 'overwrite' (as in style at a higher priority) to update your page. Super happy the course shows me how it's all connected and that Bootstrap is basically just super fancy work that someone's already done! Colt also said when making a navbar, he just copies the stuff he needs from the Bootstrap docs and piecemeals it together, or "builds it like Legos" to fit what he's looking for. I think I would have previously looked down at this method...to my own detriment. This makes perfect sense to me and as long as you understand what you're doing, there's no shame in doing it that way - at all. As I saw on a (very) random website about backpacking for the first time, it pays to do some R&D - Rip off and Duplicate!    
**2020/04/07**: continued with Udemy course learning about bootstrap grid system! Some of it brings back memories, like using 12 rows, having various screen sizes, etc, but colt explains it quite well. Learning from a teacher has alleviated a lot of the anxiety I feel when self-studying, because I tend to make everything feel SUPER important in the moment, even if ultimately it's not. Even Quincy said in a podcast that the freecodecamp exercises are meant to take 2-3 mins each max, and students should look for help if they're taking longer; but even so, I tend to grind it out and in the process sometimes become burnt out.    
**2020/04/08**: finished fCC Applied Accessibility challenges - I think this stuff is pretty important and will likely come back to reference it often.    
**2020/04/09**: attended a GDG Memphis virtual meetup with Quincy Larson and Kent C Dodds speaking! Wow - quite an interesting meetup even if I don't understand all of the React stuff Kent was talking about. I think I will continue through Colt's Udemy course, supplementing with fCC and trying to avoid getting rusty in vanilla JS using Codewars, and then, because I've heard Colt's course is a bit outdated when it comes to React, I can move to Kent's (now free!) React for Beginners course [here](https://egghead.io/courses/the-beginner-s-guide-to-react){:target="\_blank"}. Kent brought up A TON of great resources in his talk: 
* Meetup Recording (_I will add the link to the recording here when it is available_)
* Wes Bos's [JavaScript 30](https://javascript30.com/){:target="\_blank"}
* Also found out about freeCodeCamp's new [AWS exam courses](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/pass-the-aws-developer-associate-exam-with-this-free-16-hour-course/){:target="\_blank"} - it is beyond incredible to me the amount of "freesources" that fCC offers.

**2020/04/10**: finished Bootstrap 3 section of udemy course and am on to Boostrap 4! Wanted to add one more thing from the meetup last night. Danny mentioned that he always suggests that people learning to code ABB ABL CCC - Always Be Building, Always Be Learning, Code Code Code.    
**2020/04/11**: began Bootstrap 4 section of udemy course    
**2020/04/12**: completed fCC Responsive Web Design Principles css challenges, easy but important, especially the interesting media queries and viewport units.    
**2020/04/13**: continued on Bootstrap 4 lessons and worked on fCC css flexbox challenges.    
**2020/04/14**: finished Bootstrap 4 intro section of Udemy course. revisited some basic JS algorithm scripting challenges in fCC - definitely feeling a little rusty but I think the knowledge is still in there.    
**2020/04/15**: began Bootstrap 4 Flexbox lessons and it's interesting stuff!    
**2020/04/16**: continued Bootstrap 4 Flexbox lessons.    
**2020/04/17**: continued Bootsrap 4 Flexbox lessons and fCC css flexbox challenges. I want to go through the fCC grid system challenges before learning about them from the course.    
**2020/04/18**: finished fCC flexbox and grid challenges.    
**2020/04/19**: Udemy Bootstrap 4 grid lesson.    
**2020/04/20**: Began Udemy Bootstrap 4 pattern project.
