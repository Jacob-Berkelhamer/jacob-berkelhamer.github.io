## January 2020 Post-Mortem
In this post I want to detail what I think were the 3 biggest contributors towards my programming success in January:

### Committed to Learning in Public
Thank goodness I heard Quincy Larson's freeCodeCamp Radio [interview](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/shawn-wang-podcast-interview/){:target="\_blank"} of Shawn Wang. Had I not done this, there is a near-100% chance I would not have committed to Learning in Public, started this blog, nor have kept up the consistency and momentum I've built. I was pretty nervous about learning in public and putting myself out there, but so far it has been absolutely worth it, and I plan on continuing to do it! 

### Consistently working through the freeCodeCamp JS lessons and reading YDKJS
Some days it's been really tough for me to [keep going](https://jacob-berkelhamer.github.io/I-Don't-Want-to-Write-this-Post-Today/){:target="\_blank"}, but I try and push through at least one fCC lesson and at least one section of a chapter of YDKJS. When it's really tough, or I'm feeling particularly anxious about my decision to continue, I think about how much progress I've made in just under a month of work. I honestly didn't think I would make it through one chapter of YDKJS understanding anything, but so far it's been an incredible resource and I expect it to help me learn JS much faster and much deeper than I could have without it. My point here is not just to pat myself on the back for my progress (although I am proud as hell of my progress), but also to make the point that you can make more progress than you ever thought possible with consistency and perseverance. I strive to be a tortoise, working not to lose my race against my nemesis, the insolent and cocksure [hare](/images/insolentAndCocksureHare.png "a tortoise and an insolent and cocksure hare"){:target="\_blank"}.

### Working on thankyounot.es
Finally, I'm happy that I worked towards building thankyounot.es by mocking it up in CodePen. This project is teaching me about the DOM, helping me improve my CSS, and I am learning first-hand how a webpage brings HTML, CSS, and JS together. This is super cool.

### OK, one more thing: joining Albert A's AMAs and Slack group
Albert has been extremely generous with his time and has been helping us learn more about what it's like to be a professional software engineer, all while answering a bunch of random questions. Also, he's creating a community in Slack which has been exciting to interact with. I think that learning with this community will be valuable and fun!    

## Keep it movin'
Now we're a few days into February and it's time to work on a full month of programming lessons, continue making thankyounot.es, and hopefully interact with more awesome people who have made the transition from a non-traditional background into tech.
