title: January 2020 Log
---
## What is this? ##
This is a monthly log that I will use to capture my progress as I learn to code, in the spirit of Learning in Public. (Even though I'm learning in public, some of these notes may only make sense to me.)

My goals with the logs:
1. All Non-Zero days - update the log daily with the stuff I worked on.
2. Use the logs from the previous week as kindling, my goals for the following week as tinder, and my feelings in the moment as the spark to write a fire weekly blog post (and you'd better believe that if we're using logs as kindling, we're gonna light some big ol' fires). Then, tweet the summary and a link to the post.
3. Each month, create new monthly goals that can be broken down into weekly goals.

### January 2020 Goals
~~1. Create some goals for the rest of this month! (does this count?)~~
1. Complete thankyounot.es project using GitHub Pages (this is a stretch goal)
2. Reach out to at least one software dev who is self-taught and came from finance/accounting background.

### January 2020 Log

**2020-01-16**: read through r/cscareerquestions, finished freeCodeCamp debugging lessons and began basic data structures.  
**2020-01-17**: read about classes in YDKJS(Y) and finally understood them using Mozilla documentation! (I learned something! I learned something!), incidentally went down small rabbit hole and learned about the concept of hoisting, purchased thankyounot.es domain registration #LearnInPublic, continued fCC JS basic data structures lesson.   
**2020-01-18**: wrote weekly blog post [Strides and Anxieties](https://jacob-berkelhamer.github.io/Strides-and-Anxieties/) creating goals for next week, continued fCC JS basic data structures lesson.    
**2020-01-19**: specced out thankyounot.es MVP, began researching how to use Github pages and difference between static and dynamic webpages, finished fCC JS basic data structures lesson.    
**2020-01-20**: read [this](https://hackernoon.com/how-css-grid-beats-bootstrap-85d5881cf163) article about using CSS vs Bootstrap and decided to use CSS for thankyounot.es instead of Bootstrap, read further about CSS [grid](https://gridbyexample.com/) and [flexbox vs grid](https://hackernoon.com/the-ultimate-css-battle-grid-vs-flexbox-d40da0449faf), continued reading about classes and modules in YDKJSY, completed HTML mockup of thankyounot.es MVP in [codepen](https://codepen.io/jahberk/pen/VwYVgXE?editors=1000), began FCC JS Basic Algorithm Scripting lesson.    
**2020-01-21**: learned about DOM which should help with thankyounot.es by reading and completing dom-example exercises in [this](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs/Manipulating_documents) Mozilla article, continued FCC JS Basic Algorithm Scripting lesson making sure to get hint after completion to see other ways to solve problems (very fun!)    
**2020-01-22**: found out about <coolers.co>, which can be used to pick a rad color scheme for thankyounot.es. Finished ch 2 of Getting Started in YDKJS! Added a CSS grid to the mockup of thankyounot.es - side note: I have mad respect for UI designers because if adding a simple 3x3 grid was that difficult, I can't even imagine how crazy some styling jobs must get. Continued FCC JS Basic Algorithm Scripting lesson and managed to solve the challenge to repeat a string n number of times with recursion! Thought of January goal 2: Reach out to at least one software dev who is self-taught and came from finance/accounting background. Thought of an _extreme_ stretch project: turn any uploaded music file into a polyphonic ringtone.    
**2020-01-23**: set up lunch with professional SWEs to discuss their backgrounds (which are traditional CS), what they like about being SWEs, advice, etc. Began ch3 of Getting Started in YDKJS, watched Albert Alquisola live AMA and plan on joining Slack group; Lessons: when coding, constantly watch page and browser console to catch bugs, commit/save work often, learn the popular languages/frameworks (i.e. Albert put together the [project](https://github.com/albertalquisola/random-food-app) in React and recommended React because a ton of apps are built using React right now; so it's good as a prospective dev to learn it because it's more popular and therefore more likely to help get you work). Continued FCC JS Basic Algorithm Scripting lessons.
