title: January 2020 Log

## What is this? ##
This is a monthly log that I will use to capture my progress as I learn to code, in the spirit of Learning in Public. (Even though I'm learning in public, some of these notes may only make sense to me.)

My goals with this log:
1. All Non-Zero days - update the log daily with the stuff I worked on.
2. Use the log as the kindling, and my plans for the upcoming week, and my feelings as a spark to write a fire weekly blog post (and you'd better believe that if we're using logs as kindling, we're gonna light some big ol' fires). Then, tweet the summary and a link to the post.
3. Each month, create new monthly goals that can be broken down into weekly goals.
