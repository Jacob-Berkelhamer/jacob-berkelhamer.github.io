title: I Don't Want to Write this Post
---
### Week of Jan 19 2020
I don't want to be writing this right now. I want to be working on my project; I didn't get far enough along as I wanted to this week. I want to focus on the personal stuff going on in my life. I'm writing this post a day late, and nobody will probably read it anyway. What good is a commitment to learn in public if nobody is holding me accountable except for myself?    
    
It's hard to trudge forward, step by heavy step, when I'm working on a difficult project, or doing something new, or just generally stressed out. My thoughts act like a sprinter's parachute, keeping me from being able to move at full speed, and tiring myself out in the process. Sometimes, after a barrage of discouraging feelings, there's only one phrase that gives me strength to push forward: **Keep Going**.
