title: I Don't Want to Write this Post Today

### Week of Jan 19 2020
I don't want to be writing this right now. I want to be working on my project; I didn't get far enough along as I wanted to this week. I want to focus on the personal stuff going on in my life. I'm writing this post a day late, and nobody will probably read it anyway. What good is a commitment to learn in public if nobody is holding me accountable except for myself?    
    
It's hard to trudge forward, step by heavy step, when I'm working on a difficult project, or doing something new, or just generally stressed out. My thoughts act like a sprinter's parachute, keeping me from running at full speed, and tiring me out in the process.  Sometimes, after a barrage of discouraging feelings, there's only one phrase that gives me strength to push forward: **Keep Going**.    
    
Why does "Keep Going" provide me the motivation I need? Some time ago, I was binge listening to the earliest episodes of comedian Pete Holmes' podcast, You Made It Weird. In one episode, Pete interviewed a young Jerrod Carmichael, and the conversation turned to using notes on stage. To provide some context: a comic will usually bring a notepad or their phone up on stage to reference, especially when they're ironing out the kinks in newer material. Sometimes, a comic will use their notes as a crutch, or as an excuse to look away from the audience if the comic feels like they're bombing and feeling too exposed.
     
During the interview, Jerrod mentioned that he started bringing a notepad up on stage that just had two words written in it: **KEEP GOING**. Even at a young age, Jerrod had so much confidence in his voice as a comedian, he knew that even if a bit was hitting a lull with the audience, he could cross the precipice and land the joke, as long as he just kept going.    
     
Developing a project takes determination. It requires a leap of faith that you can get from an idea to a finished project, jumping past negative thoughts, setbacks, and unexpected, frustrating CSS behavior. It requires that you keep going.
