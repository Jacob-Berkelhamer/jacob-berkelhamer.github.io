## What is this? ##
This is a monthly log that I will use to capture my progress as I learn to code, in the spirit of Learning in Public. (Even though I'm learning in public, some of these notes may only make sense to me.)    

My goals with the logs:
1. All Non-Zero days - update the log daily with the stuff I worked on.
2. Use the logs from the previous week as kindling, my goals for the following week as tinder, and my feelings in the moment as the spark to write fire weekly blog posts (and you'd better believe that if we're using logs as kindling, we're gonna light some big ol' fires). Then, tweet the summary and a link to the post.
3. Each month, create new monthly goals that can be broken down into weekly goals.

### May 2020 Goals
1. Finish Web Developer Bootcamp Udemy course
2. Write at least one blog post

### May 2020 Log
**2020/05/01**: continued Udemy js arrays lessons.    
**2020/05/02**: continued Udemy js arrays lessons.
**2020/05/03**: finished Udemy js arrays lessons. the last lesson was a bonus lesson that included creating a function that was higher-order (so it took a function as an argument), and included adding the function to the Array prototype chain! this was cool (get it).    
**2020/05/04**: moving right on through the udemy js object lessons. Learning some interesting tidbits along the way, like that object keys can be strings with spaces, and that if an object key begins with an underscore, it can be accessed with dot notation without problem (even if everyone looks at you funny for starting the name of your key with an underscore). Something keeping me interested ane excited to keep moving forward these days is the prospect of working with APIs. It would be super cool to, say, write a program using Zillow's API and Twilio that sends us a text each time a new home with certain filters is put on the market in a desired geographic location. The text message could be modified with info, pics, links, etc.    
**2020/05/05**: finished the js objects section and am moving right along into the DOM section. Thinking that I'd like to go back and practice some html + css in FCC and earn my responsive web design cert...     
**2020/05/06**: continued DOM lesson    
**2020/05/07**: continued DOM manipulation lesson.    
**2020/05/08**: continued DOM manipulation lessons and finished basics - moved onto advanced lessons woop woop! This is starting to get pretty interesting! A SWE contact reached out on LinkedIn, which was nice!    
**2020/05/09**: continued DOM manipulation lessons including event listeners. Currently working on an interesting score keeper app; relatively simple but powerful stuff!    
**2020/05/10**: continued DOM manipulation lessons and learned about new event listeners. Colt mentions the [MDN Events page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events){:target="\_blank"} as a good resource.    
**2020/05/11**: finished advanced DOM manipulation lessons and am onto code following to create an rgb color guessing game. Very cool!    
**2020/05/12**: continued working on color guesser game!
