## What is this? ##
This is a monthly log that I will use to capture my progress as I learn to code, in the spirit of Learning in Public. (Even though I'm learning in public, some of these notes may only make sense to me.)    

My goals with the logs:
1. All Non-Zero days - update the log daily with the stuff I worked on.
2. Use the logs from the previous week as kindling, my goals for the following week as tinder, and my feelings in the moment as the spark to write fire weekly blog posts (and you'd better believe that if we're using logs as kindling, we're gonna light some big ol' fires). Then, tweet the summary and a link to the post.
3. Each month, create new monthly goals that can be broken down into weekly goals.

**2020/05/02**: continued Udemy js arrays lessons.
**2020/05/03**: finished Udemy js arrays lessons. the last lesson was a bonus lesson that included creating a function that was higher-order (so it took a function as an argument), and included adding the function to the Array prototype chain! this was cool (get it).
