title: Jan 12 2020 Weekly Post: Strides and Anxieties
---

This week came with many forward strides. Last week, I set a high-level life goal to **Live a long and fulfilling life** (more detail to come in future posts), and continued my journey to learn programming. I made great headway into the freeCodeCamp JS curriculum, connected with a few skilled software engineers over social media (a Quincy Larson Twitter like counts, right?), continued reading YDKJSY, began my first project by purchasing the domain rights to thankyounot.es, and committed to Learning in Public. By all accounts, this was a pretty dang successful week of learning to program. So why do I feel so anxious?

Maybe I'm a worrier by nature...and nurture. What I'd like to do in this post is list my anxieties, and **_CRUSH THEM_**, or, at the very least, try to quiet them for now. So, here's some anxieties that my brain keeps throwing at me:

#### **Anxiety #1**: You're wasting your time with this programming thing
Best case scenario, learning to program leads me to obtaining wealth beyond my wildest dreams, allowing me to make myself and everyone I love in my life as happy as possible, and fix worldwide problems. Worst case scenario, I learn a useful, cool, fun skill. Either way, my life becomes more fulfilling.

#### **Anxiety #2**: You'll stop finding this to be fun and give up (you know, like the 3 or 4 other times you tried to "learn programming")
My top-level goal isn't to have fun, it's to live a long and fulfilling life. If this stops becoming fun and I feel like quitting, as long as I still find it fulfilling, [it will pass](http://truecenterpublishing.com/zenstory/willpass.html).  My thesis here is that as long as I keep Learning in Public, connecting with skilled developers, create personally interesting projects, and create some real-world impact, this will be fulfilling, and therefore worth it.

#### **Anxiety #3**:
    
    
Anxiety 3 is blank because I am already feeling relief and a renewed sense of motivation to get going on thankyounot.es. Hallelujah! If I hadn't committed to Learning in Public, I would almost certainly not have written any of this down, and continued feeling terrible. This week, I will strive to hack together a MVP, unrefined thankyounot.es; continue working through fCC's JS lessons; and continue reading to understand YDKJSY. No need to start CS50 quite yet. 

On a final, interesting note, I've noticed that the more anxious I become, the more my brain "speaks" to me in the _You_ form, as in **You** need to get to work or **you'll** fail. Brain, can we please get to a point where we're working together, and suggestions come in the "We" form? Like: **We** should get started on this so that **we** can make it as fulfilling and successful as possible?
